The problem:
    There is a very scary dragon living in Almaty city near KBTU.
    Everyday he needs to eat several young students for a launch. He usually
    kidnaps them one by one in the morning and eats at a launch time,
    having put them in a line at a cell in his prison. But sometimes he has
    problems with his launch, because students vanish! He still doesnâ€™t know
    that pair of boy and a girl (B-G) can disappear if they stand together
    exactly in this order (B-G) due to the magic of love. After that line
    becomes smaller. So, there is a possibility that no one will be left for a
    dragon launch!
